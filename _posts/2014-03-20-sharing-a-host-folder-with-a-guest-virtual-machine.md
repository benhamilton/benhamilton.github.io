I'm using VMware Fusion on my MacBook. At times I have either files on the local host (the MacBook) that I want to edit or installers that I want to run on the guest (the virtual machine).

With your virtual machine running, click on the
**Settings**
 icon, select
**Sharing**
 |
**Shared Folders ON**
 | tick
**Downloads**
.

Your local "Downloads" folder will now be available to your virtual machine.
