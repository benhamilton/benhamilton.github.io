Off-topic, well, on topic, or both maybe: I'm finding it useful to write these 'open loops' as it's just a bunch of links that I want to come back to, without losing them. Quite frankly it's easier to find them here on my blog than anywhere else. I am the intended reader of these posts, but do let me know if your find them useful at all.
