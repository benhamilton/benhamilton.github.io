I've bought the bookÂ [**Atomic Habits**](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B01N5AX61W/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and written a short review of it.

[![Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](/images/40121378.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)<br />[Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) by [James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7327369.James_Clear)<!--more-->

For me, there have been two items in "Atomic Habits" that have immediately made a difference in my life.

The first is in Chapter 6, under the heading "The Context Is The Cue", the understanding and the realisations following my reading that our habits can be associated not with just one single 'trigger' but with the 'context' that surrounds a behaviour, have changed my day to day actions.

The second is in Chapter 7, on how 'disciplined' people structure their lives in such a way that they do not require huge amounts of willpower and self-control; has caused me to change a number of small things, and this has made a large impact for me.

Implementing these two things into my life have not required any 'rocket science' on my part, just some simple changes. Those simple changes have made an immediate, positive difference in my life.

James explanation of these two things, the examples he uses, have made sense of why, in the past, some habits have stuck for me, why others haven't, and why certain habits I've tried to change or remove haven't changed or been removed.

Thanks James!

PS. rest of the book is great, but those two things are what made the difference for me.
