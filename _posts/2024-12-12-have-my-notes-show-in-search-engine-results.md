Title: Have My Notes Show In Search Engine Results

I have for some years now kept my own notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). And it's bugged me that I'll do a search using Google or DuckDuckGo for a thing I've already made a note about, a note that actually contains the answer I'm now searching for.

This has meant that I've tried to get into the habit of searching my own notes first, but that doesn't always happen, especially when I'm already in a web browser window it's easy to open a new tab and search.

However that has now changed.

Enter [Omnisearch](https://publish.obsidian.md/omnisearch/Inject+Omnisearch+results+into+your+search+engine)

By installing this plugin in Obsidian, turning on the built in HTTP server, then installing the Omnisearch Companion, Tampermonkey, and the userscript for both Google and DuckDuckGo (the two search engines I tend to use, but Kagi and Bing are also supported) I can now search in the search engine and see my notes appear at the side of those results. SO. AWESOME.
