title: YAML Frontmatter Published False
published: false

This Jekyll post has a YAML frontmatter key of `published` set to `false' in the source markdown file like such:

```
published: false
```

Why do this? I'm doing it so that the post doesn't get published to the web. It's an easy way to do two things:

1. Unpublish a post if there are errors, although I'm more likely to edit and correct the post rather than unpublish
2. I can write it as a draft in the `_posts` folder instead of the `_drafts` folder - it's just one place for all the words.
