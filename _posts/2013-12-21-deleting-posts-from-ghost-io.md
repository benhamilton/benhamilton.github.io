After creating a new 'blog' over at [benhamilton.ghost.io](http://benhamilton.ghost.io/) I imported all my blog posts from [ben.hamilton.id.au](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/) - then realised that the post url structure was different. Unfortunately, there is no way to fix that just yet on the hosted platform (you can on a self hosted ghost setup).

Not wanting to have duplicate content in two places I wasn't looking forward to deleting a lot of posts manually. Thus was born a short recipe in [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) (if on Windows you could use [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/) to do the same).

In essence, it loops the required mouse clicks to delete a post.
