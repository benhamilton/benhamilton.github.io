I'm a newcomer to the iPad, but I've found that creating a bulleted list in an email can be rather time consuming as to get an 'asterik' (star, SHIFT-8, one of these \*) takes a few taps on the keyboard.

I've found a quicker way to make them happen, here it is:

- Go to Settings
- General
- Keyboard
- Add New Shortcut
- The 'Phrase' is '* ' (that's a star followed by a space, without the quote marks)
- The 'Shortcut' is ',,' (that's two comma's)

Now when I type two comma's followed by a space, it'll replace that with a star followed by a space. Great easy bulleted lists in emails.
