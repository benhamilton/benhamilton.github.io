I use Google Chrome as my primary browser on the MacBook.

Although I only restart the machine every few weeks I like it to re-open the same tabs that were open last.

To do this, in Google Chrome type
**chrome://settings/ **
into the address bar and press enter.

This loads the Settings page. Then check the 
**Continue where I left off**
 setting. Close the tab. You're done. :)
