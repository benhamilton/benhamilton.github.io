Just discovered a useful site [dnsrecords.io](https://dnsrecords.io/) which will show you the DNS records<!--more--> for the site you give it. You can also give it the url within the url itself, like such: [dnsrecords.io/ben.hamilton.id.au](https://dnsrecords.io/ben.hamilton.id.au) which is quite useful to be able to give to others to ensure you're both looking at the same record.

This subject comes up for me just now as I'm working to get a CNAME DNS record setup for my site hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
