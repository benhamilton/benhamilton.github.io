On Mac OS X or Linux (in fact anywhere you get the finger command) you can quickly get the weather. Jared, in our office here, just showed this to me, neato! :)

`finger brisbane@graph.no`

I particularly like the one line weather report

`finger o:brisbane@graph.no`

![graph.no](/images/graph.no_.png)

To get more info on how to use this, run this from your command line:

`finger @graph.no`

:)
