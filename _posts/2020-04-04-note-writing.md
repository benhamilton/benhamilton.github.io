I've been slowing focusing more on my writing â€” in a journal, status updates, client communications and documentation. Part of improving my writing is the taking of notes. The way I've taken notes has been rather slowly improving, but today I stumbled upon someone who is thinking and writing about writing notes. <!--more-->

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) has/is writing about [Note-writing Systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr). He's also written [Exalting data, missing meaning](https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159340765257/exalting-data-missing-meaning) which I found interesting.

He comments on [evergreen note-writing as the basic unit of measure for knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be), which is a new thought for me. I've typically measured work in terms of revenue, hours billed, or projects completed. While those measures are important, after reading his take, perhaps if I measure *evergreen notes* as the fundamental unit, that, I'm thinking will improve those other measures.

Says Andy:
> ... Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts and Note-writing practices are generally ineffective.
> - Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate
> - Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate
> - Note-writing helps writing accumulate: these notes are the fuel for the Executable strategy for writing, particularly if you Create speculative outlines while you write.

It's certainly fueling thoughts for me...
