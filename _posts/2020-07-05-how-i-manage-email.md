My sister commented that [she needs a system to manage her email](https://twitter.com/abbeydiaz_says/status/1275954452776640512). I'm not the best at this, but I do have a system that works for me. This is how I manage email.<!--more-->

I draw on a couple of principles from [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), and from [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero). They are:

1. Process it once (GTD/Inbox Zero)
2. If it takes less than two minutes, do it now (GTD)

Here's how that looks:

- I check email two or three times a day, typically once in the morning, just after lunch and late afternoon. While I feel that still to frequent, it keeps others around me happy. Checking it any less and they start to notice, checking it more frequently and they also don't notice.
- I go through the list of emails, if the FROM persons name or email address, or the subject line tells me there is nothing in this email for me, I don't even open it (newsletters, automated updates etc). This doesn't mean I don't read all newsletters or all updates, I just don't read those that can't grab me in that moment.
- Those I need to read (co-workers, clients, personal friends) and those from above that made it through that filter, I read. I'm fully there for that email.
- However, if that email loses me, like many newsletters, gone.
- If there is an action required of me, for example I need to do something, or check if others have done something, I create either a task in the appropriate system (SugarCRM, Reminders, Jira, Git) or a meeting (SugarCRM, Calendar).
- If there is something I need to refer back to, I copy it to the appropriate system (my Zettelkasten, Confluence, SugarCRM, or client/project folder)
- If it requires a reply, I reply. This takes less than two minutes. If it will take more than two minutes, it was taken care of by an earlier step, if not I go back to that prior step.

It's important to remember that email clients are not task management systems, scheduling systems or knowledge systems. In the same way that a carpenter uses the right tool for the job, as knowledge workers we too should use the right tool for the job.

Sometimes, as in this case, the *tool* is the methodology, not so much the actual tools used. The tools I use can be completely different to the tools another will use. It's the process, the methodology that matters.

Investing the time to clarify how we process a *thing* pays off over time.
