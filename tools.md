I’m often asked what software and hardware I’m using. This page answers that question.

## Hardware

I switched from living in ‘Microsoft Windows Land’ since the early 90’s to the Mac in 2013. I wish I’d done it sooner because the integration between the devices is wonderful.

- MacBook Pro - the work horse
- Mac Mini - the backup
- iPhone 8 Plus – Great handheld computer, plus it has a phone
- iPad Pro 10.5″ – with Apple keyboard cover and Apple Pencil
- I added a pen clip from the “Bullet” Fischer Space Pen to the Apple Pencil<sup id="fnbl-20200522165741"><a href="#fn-20200522165741">1</a></sup>. The Apple Pencil is finally a real digital replacement for a paper pad and pen.
- Sony WH-1000XM3 - wireless, bluetooth [noise cancelling headphones](https://helpguide.sony.net/mdr/wh1000xm3/v1/en/contents/TP0001703149.html)
- Suzuki Bandit 1250 – [my favoured transport in Australia](https://www.instagram.com/p/2Nc9Ytnbfv/)
- Honda XR400R - [my favoured transport in Vanuatu](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8rq25MnWvx/)
- Pilot Metropolitan (MR) Fountain Pens – [the pens I use the most](https://pilotpen.com.au/products/mr2-fountain/) (I now have a few of these, with different nibs, and loaded with different inks)
- Fisher Space Pen – the [SM4B Non-Reflective Military Matte Black](http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-NonReflective-Military-Cap-O-Matic-SM4B/dp/B001NXDFC8), great pen
