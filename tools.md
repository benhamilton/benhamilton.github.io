I’m often asked what software and hardware I’m using. This page attempts to answers that question.

## Hardware

I switched from living in ‘Microsoft Windows Land’ since the early 90’s to the Mac in 2013. I wish I’d done it sooner because the integration between the devices is wonderful.

- MacBook Pro - the work horse
- Mac Mini - the backup
- iPhone 8 Plus – Great handheld computer, plus it has a phone
- iPad Pro 10.5″ – with Apple keyboard cover and Apple Pencil
- I added a pen clip from the “Bullet” Fischer Space Pen to the Apple Pencil<sup id="fnbl-20200522165741"><a href="#fn-20200522165741">1</a></sup>. The Apple Pencil is finally a real digital replacement for a paper pad and pen. The iPad Pro 10.5 is the best tablet I’ve ever used, to the point where it is my primary device
- Sony WH-1000XM3 - wireless, bluetooth [noise cancelling headphones](https://helpguide.sony.net/mdr/wh1000xm3/v1/en/contents/TP0001703149.html)
