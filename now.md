Updated: 2025-10-16 from Vanuatu

Since September 2025, I've been consulting with [Stone Community Care](https://www.stonecca.org.au/) as their Digital Infrastructure Manager.
Prior to that I consulted with [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/) from 2008 to 2025, which merged with [Optimate.me](https://www.optimate.me/articles/optimate-me-and-evolution-marketing-have-merged?utm_source=ben.hamilton.id.au) in November 2024. 

I've been fully remote since 2018. My current focus is on compliance work and implementing digital infrastructure to support State Coordinators, with ongoing CRM work and future marketing automation projects.

I help solve problems in business by using CRM, Marketing Automation, and other technology, often using Agile methods. See [about](https://ben.hamilton.id.au/about) and [tools](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools) for more info. My primary interests are family, health, travel, productivity (making effective first, efficient second), Personal Knowledge Management, archery, and of course, motorcycling.

Current Projects:

- Ensuring compliance and implementing digital infrastructure to support State Coordinators at Stone Community Care.
- Ongoing CRM work and planning for future marketing automation implementations.

Also doing:

- Playing with local LLMs (LM Studio, MacWhisper) and AI tools like Claude Code. Training LLMs on information local to the device - I see locally trained LLMs as useful to both individuals and businesses, where their IP is kept local and not sent to the cloud
- Extensive community work in Vanuatu, mostly on Efate Island. Spent 2 weeks on Tanna in August 2025 helping out, and assisting with future projects that will take place on other islands.
- Riding a KTM 250 in Vanuatu.
- Visiting more islands in the Pacific

The countries I've visited, in order of first visit are:

1. Australia (Born there many moons ago)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin, Selters Tanus, and more)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (This is where I live, message me if you visit and we'll grab a coffee)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful, I *really* miss the Moo Moo)
13. Spain (Mungia, Bilbao, and more)
14. Croatia (Brač, Dubrovnik, Plitvice Lakes, and Split)
15. Bosnia (would have liked more time here)
16. Italy (Tuscany, Rome)
17. Fiji (Caught up with friends, and I've been back already for a second visit)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the list (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

Places on my shortlist to visit next (or again) are, in alphabetical order:

- Antarctica
- Australia
- Botswana
- Croatia
- Fiji 
- Germany
- India
- Madagascar
- Mauritius
- Mongolia
- Nepal
- Norway
- Spain
- Vanuatu (home sweet home)
- Zimbabwe
