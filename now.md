Right now, working remotely from Brisbane Australia. The lockdowns and border closures due to COVID-19 have meant I can't get back to the beautiful beaches of Vanuatu, thus I'm on a slightly extended Brisbane stay. 

-
- Normally, I spend my time working between [Brisbane, Australia](https://g.page/brisbane-technology-park?share) and [Port Vila, Vanuatu](https://goo.gl/maps/fZ1pYCu9v2MvsPY68) and elsewhere... where-ever I can visit.
- Senior Consultant/Solution Architect for [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/) helping clients with CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods. SugarCRM, Sugar Market, Sugar Market, StarfishETL, Act-on, MailChimp, Act!, JIRA, Confluence, Git/GitHub and [more](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools)
- Riding a Suzuki Bandit 1250 when in Australia, a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel as much as possible everywhere else.
- Researching the Zettelkasten method of taking notes, it's already changed how I note take. If that interests you, go read this book [How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_7dIVEbJ9VHTM1)

I've decided to see how many countries I can visit, so far I visited these:

1. Australia (currently spend lots of time here)
2. United States of America
3. Malaysia
4. Thailand
5. Germany
6. Denmark
7. Sweden
8. Norway
9. Austria
10. Switzerland
11. Vanuatu (and a lot of time here)
12. Nepal

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the cut (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

See what I use to do my work on the [tools](/tools) page.
