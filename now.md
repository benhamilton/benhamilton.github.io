Also doing:

- Helping with some community work in Vanuatu.
- Recently landed back in Australia at the start of Feb 2022, back from Spain, where I attended my daughters wedding in October 21, it has taken quite a bit of doing to get through the hoops to travel there and back, but *absolutely worth it!*
- Riding a Suzuki Bandit GSF1250 when in Australia, and a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel and ride as much as possible everywhere I happen to be. Trying to figure out if I can get another bike...

The countries I've visited, in order of first visit are:

1. **Australia** (One of the two places I live)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin, Selters Tanus, and more)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (The other place I live, message me if you visit)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful, I *really* miss the Moo Moo)
13. Spain (Mungia, Bilbao, and more)
14. Croatia (Brač, Dubrovnik, Plitvice Lakes, and Split)
15. Bosnia (would have liked more time here)
16. Italy (Tuscany, Rome)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the list (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

Places on my shortlist to visit next (or again) are, in alphabetical order:

- Antarctica
- Australia
- Botswana
- Croatia
- Germany
- India
- Madagascar
- Mauritius
- Mongolia
- Nepal
- Norway
- Spain
- Vanuatu (because, you know, that's where home is)
- Zimbabwe
