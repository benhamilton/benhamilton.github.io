Right now, working remotely as I have done for the last 3+ years. The lockdowns and border closures due to COVID-19 have meant that travel has been a little more difficult, but not impossible.

The primary project I'm working on at the moment is for a client that brings currently outsourced operations inhouse to the client. The moving parts for this are SugarCRM, telepohony, mapping, on premise applications, data movement inbound and outbound. Enjoying digging deep into the issues and workflows.
There are a couple of other smaller projects on the periphery, all related to my core skills thank goodness.

- Solution Architect for [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/), basically helping our clients understand and solve their problems using CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods. SugarCRM, Sugar Market, Sugar Market, Zendesk, StarfishETL, Act-on, MailChimp, Act!, JIRA, Confluence, Git/GitHub and [more](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools)
- Riding a Suzuki Bandit GSF1250 & Suzuki GS500 when in Australia, a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel and ride as much as possible everywhere I happen to be.
- Still learning more about the Zettelkasten method of taking notes, it's already changed how I note take. If that interests you, go read this book [How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_7dIVEbJ9VHTM1)

The countries I've visited, in order of visit are:

1. **Australia** (One of the two places I live)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin & Selters Tanus, part of my heart is here)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (The other place I live. You should visit.)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful, I *really* miss the Moo Moo)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the cut (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

Places on my shortlist to visit next are, in alphabetical order:

- Germany
- India
- Italy
- Madagascar
- Mongolia
- Nepal
- Norway
- Spain
