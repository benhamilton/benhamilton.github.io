Right now, working remotely as I have done for the last 3+ years. The lockdowns and border closures due to COVID-19 have meant that travel has been a little more difficult, but not impossible.

Senior Solution Architect for [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/), basically helping our clients understand and solve their problems using CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods, see [about](https://ben.hamilton.id.au/about) and [tools](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools) for more info. I've been with Evolution Marketing since 2008.

Current Projects:

- Project implementing SugarCRM with an integration to custom ERP.
- Project implementing Zendesk Sell to help sales and admin, give management improved visibility into what's occuring.
- Phase two of a project with SugarCRM doing custom integrations with external providers.
- Project to migrate from SugarCRM Ent to SugarCRM Sell, revise and rework sales and admin processes as we do.

Also doing:

- Riding a Suzuki Bandit GSF1250 & Suzuki GS500 when in Australia, and a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel and ride as much as possible everywhere I happen to be.
- Recurve bow archery, outdoors at 20 and 30 metres with 28lb limbs.
- Practicing [Zettelkasten](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_7dIVEbJ9VHTM1) note taking, using Logseq and Obsidian on local markdown files in a git repo.

The countries I've visited, in order of visit are:

1. **Australia** (One of the two places I live)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin & Selters Tanus, part of my heart is here)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (The other place I live. You should visit.)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful, I *really* miss the Moo Moo)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the cut (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

Places on my shortlist to visit next are, in alphabetical order:

- Antarctica
- Botswana

- Madagascar
