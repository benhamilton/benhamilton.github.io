Right now, working remotely from Brisbane Australia. The lockdowns and border closures due to COVID-19 have meant I can't get back to the beautiful beaches of Vanuatu, thus I'm on a slightly extended Brisbane stay. 

- Normally, I spend my time working between [Brisbane, Australia](https://g.page/brisbane-technology-park?share) and [Port Vila, Vanuatu](https://goo.gl/maps/fZ1pYCu9v2MvsPY68) and elsewhere... where-ever I can visit.
- Senior Consultant/Solution Architect for [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/) helping clients with CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods. SugarCRM, Sugar Market, Sugar Market, StarfishETL, Act-on, MailChimp, Act!, JIRA, Confluence, Git/GitHub and [more](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools)
- Riding a Suzuki Bandit 1250 when in Australia, a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel as much as possible everywhere else.
- Researching the Zettelkasten method of taking notes, it's already changed how I note take. If that interests you, go read this book [How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_7dIVEbJ9VHTM1)

I've decided to see how many countries I can visit, so far the list of those I've visited are, in order of visit are:

1. **Australia** (One of the two places I live)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin & Selters Tanus, part of my heart is here)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (The other place I live. You should visit.)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the cut (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!
