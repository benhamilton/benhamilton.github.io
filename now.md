- Spend my time working between [Brisbane Australia](https://g.page/brisbane-technology-park?share) and [Port Vila, Vanuatu](https://goo.gl/maps/fZ1pYCu9v2MvsPY68) and elsewhere
- Senior Consultant/Solution Architect forÂ [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/) helping clients with CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods. SugarCRM, Sugar Market, Act-on, MailChimp, Act!, JIRA, Confluence, Git/GitHub and [more](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools)
- Using Python more frequently as a *software multi-tool*
- Riding a Suzuki Bandit 1250 when in Australia, a Honda XR400R when in Vanuatu and trying to travel as much as possible everywhere else.

I've decided to see how many countries I can visit, so far I visited these:

1. Australia (currently spend lots of time here)
2. United States of America
3. Malaysia
4. Thailand
5. Germany
6. Denmark
7. Sweden
8. Norway
9. Austria
10. Switzerland
11. Vanuatu (and a lot of time here)
12. Nepal

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the cut (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!
