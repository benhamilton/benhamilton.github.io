Working at [Evolution Marketing Services](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/) since 2008, and fully remote since 2018. Current role is as a [Senior Solution Architect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhamilton/).

I help our clients understand and solve their problems using CRM and Marketing Automation using Agile methods, see [about](https://ben.hamilton.id.au/about) and [tools](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/tools) for more info. My primary interests are family, health, travel, productivity (making effective first, efficent second), Personal Knowledge Management, archery, and of course, motorcycling.


Current Projects:

- Project implementing [SugarCRM](https://www.sugarcrm.com/?utm_source=ben.hamilton.id.au) for a national healthcare company in Australia.

Also doing:

- Playing with local LLMs and training them on information local to the device, I see locally trained LLMs as useful to both individuals and businesses, where their IP is kept local and not sent to the cloud
- Helping with some community work in Vanuatu.
- Riding a KTM 250 in Vanuatu, and a Suzuki Bandit 1250 when in Australia.
- Visiting more islands in the Pacific

The countries I've visited, in order of first visit are:

1. **Australia** (One of the two places I live)
2. United States of America (Colorado was fab. New York better than expected)
3. Malaysia (so. many. people.)
4. Thailand (Chang Mai. Felt like home)
5. Germany (Münster, Berlin, Selters Tanus, and more)
6. Denmark (enjoyed the train ride)
7. Sweden (Old Town Stockholm was great, company was even better)
8. Norway (Hurtigruten! Fjords! Dog sleds! [WOW!!](https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-webcams/hurtigruten/ms-richard-with2/))
9. Austria (awesome snow)
10. Switzerland (beautiful)
11. **Vanuatu** (The other place I live, message me if you visit)
12. Nepal (mountains are amazing, people beautiful, I *really* miss the Moo Moo)
13. Spain (Mungia, Bilbao, and more)
14. Croatia (Brač, Dubrovnik, Plitvice Lakes, and Split)
15. Bosnia (would have liked more time here)
16. Italy (Tuscany, Rome)
17. Fiji (Caught up with friends, I'll be back)

I don't count countries where I didn't leave the airport, so New Zealand and Qatar haven't yet made the list (yet) but even with them, I've still visited fewer countries than one of my kids, she is the real *globetrotter*!

Places on my shortlist to visit next (or again) are, in alphabetical order:

- Antarctica
- Australia
- Botswana
- Croatia
- Fiji 
- Germany
- India
- Madagascar
- Mauritius
- Mongolia
- Nepal
- Norway
- Spain
- Vanuatu (because, you know, that's where home is)
- Zimbabwe
